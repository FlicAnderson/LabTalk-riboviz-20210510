## HOW TO (RE-)USE THIS MATERIAL

This is a `.html` presentation created in `R Markdown` with `ioslides`. 

(It's been written in a [.Rmd](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file, and we generated .html slides by 'knitting' it in Rstudio.)

You can check out the code used to make these slides at the [Workshop repo](https://github.com/FlicAnderson/20201127-gitflow-workshop) on Github, and adapt it for your own presentations if you like - we've got a MIT Licence on the repo, which means: 

*"Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source."*
